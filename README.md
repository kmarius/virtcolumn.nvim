This plugin is based on [lukas-reineke/virt-column.nvim](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/virt-column.nvim),
then why not submit pr, but a new repository, because the content of the modification of this plugin
and the original use of the way completely incompatible, and can even be considered two completely different plugins

## Install

requires nvim0.7+nightly which has `nvim_create_autocmd`

Same as other normal plugins, use your favourite plugin manager to install.

## Configuration

This plugin is aiming for zero configuration, you just need to install and make
sure this plugin loaded and it will automatically handle `colorcolumn`

### char

### highlight

**`VirtColumn`**

Use `ColorColumn`s background color by default, otherwise link to `NonText`
